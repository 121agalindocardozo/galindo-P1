							<h2>About Me</h2>
						
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Hello. My name is Alexander Galindo. I am 17 years old, hispanic and bilangual, and in my third year of studying web design at Freehold High School. I really enjoy web desing because it allows me to be as creative as I want when making a website about things that interest me. Even when making informational websites I still have the ability to make it look pretty and intriguing for the person visiting my website while giving them useful information whether its  city guide or a concert venue. Learning web design was a good decision that I made because it can be a useful skill anywhere. Like learning a new language except it was so much more easier</p>
							<p>After I graduate from school I plan on studying law and psychology. I plan on being a forensic psychologist because it is something that has always interested me and I feel that having the skill of knowing html and css can help me in whatever future career i choose.</p>
